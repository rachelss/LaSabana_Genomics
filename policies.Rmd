## Workshop Protocol

* Bring your laptop to every class. 
* Be prepared to work on the day's material (this may mean reviewing prior to class)
* Be kind to others. Remember that people have different backgrounds and experiences with the material. Students who learn the material faster should consider helping others (teaching is an excellent way to improve your understanding of the material).
* If you come in late, please do not disrupt the class. Please ensure all cell phones and other electronic devices are set to silent.
* Treat everyone with dignity and respect. Students are responsible for being familiar with and adhering to the Software Carpentry Code of Conduct (https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html).
* Students with disabilities should let the instructor know so that we may arrange reasonable accommodations.
